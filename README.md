UART Controller with Baud Rate Generator and FIFO
A highly configurable UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) IP core designed for reliable serial communication, featuring a programmable baud rate generator and FIFO (First-In-First-Out) buffers for efficient data handling.

Key Features
Programmable Baud Rate Generator

Supports standard baud rates (9600, 115200, etc.) and custom frequencies

Automatic divisor calculation based on system clock

Error < 1% clock accuracy

Dual FIFO Buffers

16-byte deep FIFOs for both TX and RX paths (configurable depth)

Reduces data loss risk during high-speed communication

Status flags for FIFO full/empty conditions

Flexible Configuration

Configurable data format: 5-9 data bits

Optional parity (even, odd, none)

1 or 2 stop bits selection

Break character detection

Robust Error Handling

Frame error detection

Parity error checking

Overflow detection
